> My personal UI sandbox for components, layouts, and themes that I don't want to chuck into the void.

## 🐡 About this repo
Sometimes, I work on projects and I end up with some cool UI that I really, really like, but doesn't fit the project. It might just be because I want to store it for future reference or because I just like looking at it.
So this repo exists for me to dump these things I don't want to use, but want to keep.

This is my playground, my storage, and my dump for all things UI.

## 🧋 What's here?
A collection of random things I made that I think are interesting, like:
- Standalone CSS/HTML components
- Layouts and stuff
- Unused theme concepts (color palletes, typography, etc)
- Whatever else

## 📑 Structure
Each experiment will have its own little room where it can exist by itself as a standalone piece. Yes, even a single button or tiny component will have its own place. 

Is this efficient? Probably not but this is my digital storage container

## 👀 Lil note on usage
I sometimes build things directly in this repo, or upload them from other projects as-is. I might modify them later if I feel like it. The code is primarily for my own archival purposes, but you're welcome to use it for inspiration.
