# 🥛 blasted-glass
> **My personal UI Vault.** A playground for full-page website concepts, experimental designs, and layout ideas that pop into my head.

## 🐡 About this repo
Sometimes, I work on projects and I end up with some cool UI that I really, really like, but doesn't fit the project. It might just be because I want to store it for future reference or because I just like looking at it. Or, I might just have a random idea for a website, or have some old files that I'd like to archive (like the digital receipt archive), that I want to build just for the fun of it.

> [!NOTE]
> This projects seems to have become a mini-portfolio of sorts. I've stashed my website recreates (and links to existing ones) here. I also plan to include designs I've made.

## 🧋 What's here?
Not a component library! Macro-design stuff:
- Full website concepts
- Layouts I find interesting
- Self-contained designs with their own unique global styles
- Website recreates
- Graphic design stuff
- Wireframes/mockups
- Whatever else

## 👀 Lil note on usage
I sometimes build things directly in this repo, or upload them from other projects as-is. I might modify them later if I feel like it. The code is primarily for my own archival purposes, but you're welcome to use it for inspiration.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Website recreations are for educational purposes only. Original designs and assets belong to their respective owners.
